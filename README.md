# Landing Page
**Project Description**
The Landing Page Project is an example of the power of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by the following:
- Creating sections and its navigation bar.
- scrolling on-click.

**Instructions**
after running the (index.html) file, you will be on the page, 
you can choose any section and scroll along to the whole page.
when you are at the end of the page, you can use the button "up" 
to be back on the top of the page. 


**Features**

1) created a dynamic navigation bar, and every section added to the index.html,it has its item in the nav bar.
2)The page scroll smoothly into every section selected
3) there is a button that navigates you to the top of the page
4) responsive design to all devices



**coding**	

1)`index.html` and `css/styles.css` are by Udacity.
2) i added three sections to test the functionalty of the navigation bar (to add the sections to it).
3) i edited a little in the (style.css) and all the work was done in (app.js).
4) used (getBoundingClientRect()) to identfiy the selected section in the viewport.
